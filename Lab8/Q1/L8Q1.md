# Lab8 Exercise1

## Scenario 1

1. What combination of parameters is producing the hit rate you observe?
```
0
```
2. What is our hit rate if we increase Rep Count arbitrarily? Why?
```
The hit rate remains to be 0 no matter how we increase Rep Count.
All access to memory are more than two words apart, cache always makes new space for new memory. There could never be a cache hit.
```
3. How could we modify our program parameters to maximize our hit rate?
```
We can set step size to 1.
```
4. Associativity: 1 (Venus won't let you change this, why?)
```
We have set "direct mapping".
```
5. Cache Size (Bytes): 32 (Why?)
```
sizeOfEachBlock * numberOFBlocks = 32
```

## Scenario 2

1. What combination of parameters is producing the hit rate you observe?
```
0.75
Each step is 8 bytes. The size of a cache block is 16 bytes, which means that data are loaded every two steps.
In each step, we execute "lw" and "sw" for 2 times in total.
Hence we load new data into the cache (and meet a cache miss) every 4 read/write.
```
2. What happens to our hit rate as Rep Count goes to infinity? Why?
```
Hit rate goes to 1.
The size of the cache is 256 bytes, while the size of all data used is also 256 bytes.
In the first loop, we have loaded all data needed into the cache.
From the second repetition and so on, the hit rate is 100%.
Hence the overall hit rate goes to 1. 
```
3. Suppose we have a program that uses a very large array and during each Rep, we apply a different operator to the elements of our array. How can we restructure our program to achieve a hit rate like that achieved in this scenario? What is this technique called? ([Hint](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/cache-blocking-techniques.html))
```
Cache Blocking (as displayed in the link).
Process data in groups.
The size of a group should fix into the cache.
After completing all operations for the group, we load the next group.
```

## Scenario 3

1. Run the simulation a few times. Every time, set a different seed value. Note that the hit rate is non-deterministic. What is the range of its hit rate? Why is this the case?
```
Theoretically, the hit rate should between 0 and 0.5.
No matter what the seed is, there are no possiblity for a single cache hit in the first loop -- steps are too large for cache blocks.
In the second repetiton, the best case is all data needed are still in the cache, result in 100% hit rate in the second loop.
On the other hand, there are also possibility that all cache are evicted out, hence 0 hit rate. 
```
2. Which Cache parameter can you modify in order to get a constant hit rate? Record the parameter and its value (and be prepared to show your TA a few runs of the simulation). How does this parameter allow us to get a constant hit rate? And explain why the constant hit rate value is that value.
```
We can modify Placement Policy to "Directly Mapped", we will get constant hit rate of 0.5
All cache access in the first repetition result in cache miss, while the rest gets cache hit.
```
