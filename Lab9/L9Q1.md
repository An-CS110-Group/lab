# Exercise 1: Familiarize Yourself

1. Four floating point divisions in single precision (i.e. float)
```
__m128 _mm_div_ps (__m128 a, __m128 b)

#include <xmmintrin.h>
Instruction: divps xmm, xmm
CPUID Flags: SSE

Divide packed single-precision (32-bit) floating-point elements in a by packed elements in b, and store the results in dst.
```
2. Sixteen max operations over signed 8-bit integers (i.e. char)
```
__m128i _mm_max_epi8 (__m128i a, __m128i b)

#include <smmintrin.h>
Instruction: pmaxsb xmm, xmm
CPUID Flags: SSE4.1

Compare packed signed 8-bit integers in a and b, and store packed maximum values in dst.
```
3. Arithmetic shift right of eight signed 16-bit integers (i.e. short)
```
__m128i _mm_sra_epi16 (__m128i a, __m128i count)

#include <emmintrin.h>
Instruction: psraw xmm, xmm
CPUID Flags: SSE2

Shift packed 16-bit integers in a right by count while shifting in sign bits, and store the results in dst.
```
