## Exercise 1

1. What do the `.data`, `.word`, `.text` directives mean (i.e. what do you use them for)?

```
Store subsequent items in the static segment at the next available address.
Store listed values as unaligned 32-bit words.
Store subsequent instructions in the text segment at the next available address.

In venus, static segment starts at 0x1000_0000, text segment starts ar 0x0000_0000.
```

2. Run the program to completion. What number did the program output? What does this number represent?

```
It outputs 34.
Represents the result of fib(n).
```

3. At what address is `n` stored in memory?

```
0x10000010 (The value of register t3 after "la t3 n")
```

4. Without using the “Edit” tab, have the program calculate the 13th fib number (0-indexed) by *manually* modifying the value of a register.

```
We can modify the value of register t3 to 13 at the first time when we reached the label "fib".
```
