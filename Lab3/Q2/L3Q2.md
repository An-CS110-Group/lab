## Exercise 2

1. The register representing the variable `k`.

```
t0
```

2. The registers acting as pointers to the `source` and `dest` arrays.

```
source: t4, initially t1
dest: t6, initially t2
```

3. The assembly code for the loop found in the C code.

```
loop:
	slli t3, t0, 2
	add t4, t1, t3
	lw t5, 0(t4)
	beq t5, x0, exit
	add t6, t2, t3
	sw t5, 0(t6)
	addi t0, t0, 1
	jal x0, loop
```

4. How the pointers are manipulated in the assembly code.

```
The pointers are increased by 4 each loop:
	slli t3, t0, 2
	addi t0, t0, 1
```
