`main.c`

### 64

``` plain
Size of char: 1
Size of short: 2
Size of short int: 2
Size of int: 4
Size of long int: 8
Size of unsigned int: 4
Size of void *: 8
Size of size_t: 8
Size of float: 4
Size of double: 8
Size of int8_t: 1
Size of int16_t: 2
Size of int32_t: 4
Size of int64_t: 8
Size of time_t: 8
Size of clock_t: 8
Size of struct tm: 56
Size of NULL: 8
```

### 32

``` plain
Size of char: 1
Size of short: 2
Size of short int: 2
Size of int: 4
Size of long int: 4
Size of unsigned int: 4
Size of void *: 4
Size of size_t: 4
Size of float: 4
Size of double: 8
Size of int8_t: 1
Size of int16_t: 2
Size of int32_t: 4
Size of int64_t: 8
Size of time_t: 4
Size of clock_t: 4
Size of struct tm: 44
Size of NULL: 4
```

### Memory alignment

``` plain
struct tm
{
  int tm_sec;			/* Seconds.	[0-60] (1 leap second) */
  int tm_min;			/* Minutes.	[0-59] */
  int tm_hour;			/* Hours.	[0-23] */
  int tm_mday;			/* Day.		[1-31] */
  int tm_mon;			/* Month.	[0-11] */
  int tm_year;			/* Year	- 1900.  */
  int tm_wday;			/* Day of week.	[0-6] */
  int tm_yday;			/* Days in year.[0-365]	*/
  int tm_isdst;			/* DST.		[-1/0/1]*/

# ifdef	__USE_MISC
  long int tm_gmtoff;		/* Seconds east of UTC.  */
  const char *tm_zone;		/* Timezone abbreviation.  */
# else
  long int __tm_gmtoff;		/* Seconds east of UTC.  */
  const char *__tm_zone;	/* Timezone abbreviation.  */
# endif
};
```
####Consider 64-bit version of executable: ```Size of struct tm: 56```
####Yet 9 "int"s, 1 "long int" and 1 "void *" should have taken 52 bytes.

``` plain
struct tm_more
{
  int tm_sec;			/* Seconds.	[0-60] (1 leap second) */
  int tm_min;			/* Minutes.	[0-59] */
  int tm_hour;			/* Hours.	[0-23] */
  int tm_mday;			/* Day.		[1-31] */
  int tm_mon;			/* Month.	[0-11] */
  int tm_year;			/* Year	- 1900.  */
  int tm_wday;			/* Day of week.	[0-6] */
  int tm_yday;			/* Days in year.[0-365]	*/
  int tm_isdst;			/* DST.		[-1/0/1]*/
  int additional;

# ifdef	__USE_MISC
  long int tm_gmtoff;		/* Seconds east of UTC.  */
  const char *tm_zone;		/* Timezone abbreviation.  */
# else
  long int __tm_gmtoff;		/* Seconds east of UTC.  */
  const char *__tm_zone;	/* Timezone abbreviation.  */
# endif
};
```
####The ```struct tm_more``` above that contains one more int still takes 56 bytes.
####We can assume that structs are aligned to 8 bytes in 64-bit version, hence four more bytes are assigned.
